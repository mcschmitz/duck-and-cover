**Duck and Cover allows you to create your own album covers based on
additional information like the genre and the release year of your
artificial performer.**

Duck and Cover uses data from over 100000 top artists of over
[3000 genres](data/genres.txt) to learn about the structure and
appearance of let's say a thrash metal album cover from 1988.
